# Pod 4 Repo

# To do before each breakout session:

git pull on the main branch.

- To check which branch you are on, use git branch
- To change to main use, git checkout main.
- Then you can do git pull.
When you pull, you will get all the new files and changes made by our pod. You will also be able to find the class challenges in the challenge folder.

# To do after you complete your challenge:

Create your own branch. a good branch name is something like this: mia-nba_challenge

- git checkout -b [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME] --> git checkout -b mia-nba_challenge
- git status -> check for new or modified files
- git add [FILE NAME] --> add file so git will track it
- git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE" --> commit file to git
- git push --> push it to the repo

- Now go to https://github.com/miajackson/pod_4_repo and find the button to create a pull request.
- Make sure your base is miajackson/pod_4_repo
- Give a short summary of what you are commiting
- Create Pull Request

I will review your pull request, make any comments, and merge it to our main repo!

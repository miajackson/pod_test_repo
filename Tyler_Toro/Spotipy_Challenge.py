# Spotipy Challenges
#
# In this challenge, we'll access data from the Spotipy API to compare popularities for various artists

# Note: if you would like to play around more with the Spotify API, go fill out this form to sign up 
# for a Spotify Developer account, https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/, if you don't have a 
# Spotify account, you can sign up for one here as well (it's free!). Once signed up, it will take you 
# to a dashboard, and you can click 'Create A Client ID', to register a new 'project' 
# (we are not actually making a new project, this is just what language Spotify uses so that you 
# can generate multiple API keys). And then copy the client ID and client secret for your new project 
# to use whenever! But this may not be necessary to complete the challenge.

# Before you get started: Installing and loading spotipy library
#
# For this challenge, we'll need to install a python library called 'spotipy', then load it, as well 
# as the json library

# To get started with the spotipy API, we need to first install it, in your terminal, run this command:
# pip install spotipy --upgrade


print("Question 1\n")
# 1 Import the spotipy API to be able to use it in this challenge
print("IMPORTING \"spotipy\", \"json\", \"pandas\"\n")
import spotipy

# We'll need this to print the resulting data nicely
import json

# To access authorised Spotify data, do not edit these next few lines, they are just needed to make 
# our function calls actually work
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

# Do not edit these unless you have your own Spotify Developer account
CLIENT_ID = '99b361927f674edfb28a342956235d47'
CLIENT_SECRET = '3657ba71ed0d480fb415e96b4cbef89c'

client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID, client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET)
# spotify object to access API
sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)

# The results for the function calls we will be making are a little bit hard to parse, so formatting a 
# string from the Python JSON object might help here. Here, we've provided a function called `jprint()` 
# that you can call on the output of your search to try to look at the search result as a formatted 
# string
# you do not have to edit this function at all!!!
def jprint(obj):
    # create a formatted string of the Python JSON object
    text = json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=4)
    print(text)

# IMPORTANT NOTE: FOR THIS CHALLENGE, EVERY FUNCTION YOU CALL WILL HAVE TO START WITH sp 
# (i.e. sp.search() and whatever else), BECAUSE THAT IS THE NAME OF THE SPOTIPY OBJECT WE 
# CREATED! WITHOUT THE sp, YOUR FUNCTION CALLS WILL NOT WORK!!!

print("Question 2\n")
# 2 Search for an artist!
#
# Using the spotipy documentation (https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/), figure out how to access
# the spotify search function to search for an artist with only their name, for example 'Beyonce'. 
# (Hint: the query is the name)

# lets go get an artist! Does the spotipy function need any special parameters?

name = "beyonce"  # chosen artist
# result =   # fill this in
print("\tSetting variable \"result\" = sp.search\n".upper())
result = sp.search(name, limit=4, offset=0, type='artist', market=None) 
# this is how we will print out our results of spotipy queries. What format is this output?
jprint(result) # uncomment if you want to see the results


print("Question 3\n")
# Figure out how to choose the top artist from the search, and get that artist's id
#

''' Set search limit to 1 to get the top search result.

'''
print("Set search limit to 1 to get the top search result??\n\n".upper())
# Each artist in spotify has a unique ID. The challenge is here that the we've basically done the 
# equivalent of typing 'Beyonce' into the spotify search bar. However, for further use in looking up 
# artist info we need the **id** for the artist -- there is a unique id for each artist that is a long
# string.
#
# So, we want to find the first artist returned by that search and get the id for that artist
#
# **Hint**: The result of the search is a nested data structure. How can you explore the nested 
# *layers* of this structure to pull out the right information?

# this returns the first element of the list of 'items'
# each 'item' is a dictionary for an artist returned from the search
# we take item 0 here -- this is 'Beyonce'
# items after 0 are similar searches, but not Beyonce herself

# How popular is BeyoncÃ©? Using her unique artist ID, now let's pull popularity and followers
#

# through the nested objects to find the popularity and followers
#
# Figure out how to print how many followers Beyonce has and how popular she is in a variable 
# called artist_info
#

# Include columns for artist name, id, popularity, and followers

# note: try to use artists that don't have special characters in their name (like no accent marks

# One way to do this:
#   - set up an empty list to hold your dictionaries for each artist
#   - loop through artist names and
#       - search that artist using sp.search(), then get artist id
#       - use sp.artist() to get artist info
